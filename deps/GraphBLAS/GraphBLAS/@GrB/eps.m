function C = eps (G)
%EPS spacing of numbers in a GraphBLAS matrix.
% C = eps (G) returns the spacing of numbers in a floating-point GraphBLAS

% FUTURE: GraphBLAS should have a built-in unary operator to
% compute eps.

% convert to a built-in full matrix and use the built-in eps:

% FUTURE: there should be a sparse version of 'eps'.  C is full because
% eps (0) is 2^(-1024).
